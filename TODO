- Figure out if it's cheaper to reset the dt initial guess every step between
  t0 and tf. Currently the algorithm recycles the dt chosen from the previous
  time step, so dt will only get smaller as the algorithm marches from t0 to tf
  (or it may stay the same after the first step, assuming the tolerance is
  satisfied on every subsequent step). If the chosen dt from the first step is
  much smaller than it needs to be for the subsequent steps, then we waste a
  lot of flops by taking unnecessary tiny steps. On the other hand, by
  resetting dt to dt0 between every step, we are guaranteed to do some extra
  flops.
