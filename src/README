This is a SIMD adaptive integrator for ODEs, using the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
(RKF45) method. It solves independent, single ODEs simultaneously; it does NOT
solve systems of coupled ODEs. Its design was inspired by a problem faced in
the Nyx cosmology code, where one must integrate a single radiation
heating/cooling ODE at each grid point. The ODE at each grid point has the same
functional form and the same limits of integration, but has different initial
conditions.
